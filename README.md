# YHills_Project
Project1:
Project1 is based on Seven Segment LED Interfacing.Seven segment displays consist of 7 LEDs, called segments, arranged in the shape of an “8”. Most 7-segment displays actually have 8 segments, with a dot on the right side of the digit that serves as a decimal point. Each segment is named with a letter A to G, and DP for the decimal point.
It mainly deals with continuous blinking of LEDs in order to display number 8 on the screen.The Arduino Code,Proteus simulation and screenshot of output is attached below.
Project2:
Project 2 is based on displaying  custom characters on 16×2 character lcd using arduino uno microcontroller.Custom characters are self made characters which we design by our own.
I have implemented the custom characters such as inverted heart,sad emoji and armdown person.First the required characters byte array are declared in code. Byte arrays are declared in binary as well as hexadecimal format.The createChar() command in ardunio ide is very important. It creates/puts the character matrix/array against an addres in CG-RAM of 16×2 lcd.The Arduino Code,Proteus simulation and screenshot of output is attached below.
